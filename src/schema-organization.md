# Schema Organization Strategy

## Current Structure
- Files are organized by domain (auth, india, regions, etc.)
- Combined into a single schema at build time

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Create a Schema Documentation System
- Document each type with consistent headers explaining:
  - Purpose of the type
  - Key relationships
  - When to create new instances
  - Versioning strategy

### 2. Create Visual Diagrams
- Generate entity relationship diagrams for each domain
- Create a high-level diagram showing connections between domains

### 3. Establish Clear Naming Conventions
- Prefix types by domain (_Indian_, _Geo_, etc.) - already doing this well
- Document the meaning of suffixes (_Version_, _Region_, etc.)
- Create a glossary of terms
